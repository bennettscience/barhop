# Barhop

## I am no longer maintaining this theme. The live demo has been taken offline.

Barhop is a lightweight theme designed for Anchor CMS. Page templates are in minimal PHP and focus on the writing, not the extra stuff. Some features include:

- Markdown and HTML editing in Anchor
- Fully mobile-responsive design
- Featured image included in blog list (see below for setup)
- Flickr image credits automatically added ([blog post](http://blog.ohheybrian.com/more-attribution-done-just-for-you/)).
- Post descriptions displayed on home page
- Comment permalinks
- Category article counts in the sidebar

Currently, the Barhop theme is only available for Anchor. I'm planning on porting it over to Wordpress if I can get around to it.

##Setup

There are a few customizations you'll need to make in order to take advantage of the features.

#### Featured Images
Barhop uses featured images to give a clean, modern look to your blog, but it must be enabled by the user. To do so:

1. Create a new Custom Field under **Extend > Custom Fields** in your admin settings
2. Enter the following in the form:
   - Type: **post**
   - Field: **text**
   - Unique Key: **featured_image** (this is the slug used by Anchor)
   - Label: **Featured Image**
3. Click **Update**
4. To set a featured image in the post editor:
   - Scroll to the bottom of the editor
   - Paste an image source URL into the Featured Image field.
   - Images can be static *or* animated GIFs.

**If you do not set up a featured image, or don't set an image, a random color will be applied to the Home page and the post header.**

### Twitter
Anchor CMS is so light because it comes completely unconfigured.

Set up a reusable username variable:

1. Create a new Custom Field under **Extend > Site Variables** in the admin settings.
2. Enter the following in the config form:
   - Name: **twitter_account**
   - Value: **yourusername** - do **not** include '@'!
